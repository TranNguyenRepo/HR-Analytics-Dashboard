Operationally, it would be highly beneficial to restructure the RN Case Manager coverage. Specifically, having three dedicated RNCMs supported by a fourth RNCM focused on admissions and transitional patient pickups would significantly enhance workflow efficiency. This model would allow the primary RNCMs to maintain continuity of care while ensuring timely onboarding of new patients.

Additionally, expanding to four nurses would make the on-call schedule more sustainable. As it stands, call responsibilities can be burdensome and impact both morale and patient care. A more balanced distribution would alleviate strain and promote a healthier work environment for the clinical team.
","I strongly encourage that the branch be managed with a business-minded approach rather than one driven by personal relationships. Professional boundaries and accountability are essential to fostering a culture of respect, equity, and high-quality care. When team dynamics are influenced by social alliances, it undermines morale, disrupts workflow, and compromises the integrity of patient care.

It is imperative that all team members, especially nurses, remain open to questions, collaborative dialogue, and shared problem-solving. The tendency to respond defensively with statements such as ï¿½I put it in my documentationï¿½ discourages meaningful communication and weakens interdisciplinary support. None of us are immune to occasional oversights, and a healthy team culture should prioritize mutual support and continuous improvement over fault-finding and gossip.

Additionally, staffing levels must be addressed proactively. Even when census is lower, maintaining adequate coverage with nurses and CNAs is critical to reducing burnout, improving retention, and ensuring that documentation and care responsibilities can be completed during regular business hours. When staff are consistently forced to document after hours due to workload constraints, it signals a systemic issue that deserves immediate attention. Same applies when the CNAs not on call are working well past 5pm. 

Investing in a more balanced, professional, and collaborative environment will not only improve team cohesion but also elevate the standard of care we provide to patients and families.

Itï¿½s essential that marketers maintain appropriate boundaries when engaging in discussions related to clinical care, whether with patients, families, facilities, or colleagues. While one marketer consistently demonstrates respect for these limits, another has shown a pattern of deflecting responsibility and assigning blame when outcomes are not favorable. This behavior undermines team cohesion and can compromise trust across disciplines.

Additionally, decisions that impact staff scheduling, such as assigning a CNA to visit a facility five times per week in addition to their existing caseload, should be made in collaboration. The CNA and RNCM at the Sweetwater branch were informed of this change without prior consultation, which raises concerns about feasibility, workload, and respect for staff input.

Further, after the RNCM was given approval by Summer to speak with Sweetwater Healthcare regarding a potential reduction in daily visits (particularly given that two patients frequently refuse care), it was discovered that Zach had already spoken with Debbie, the Director of Nursing. Based on that conversation, the directive was that the CNA must continue to offer daily visits, even if they are consistently declined. If declined they could then be canceled. This decision was communicated without involving the RNCM, who should have been the one to initiate that discussion with facility nursing staff.

This is yet another example of the importance of role clarity. Clinical decisions, especially those involving visit frequency, patient engagement, and care coordination, should be led by licensed clinicians. When non-clinical staff make unilateral decisions or bypass appropriate channels, it not only disrupts workflow but also diminishes the integrity of patient-centered care.
